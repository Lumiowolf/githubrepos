Githubrepos proejct allow you to search for GitHub user and see their repos along with total count of stargazers.

# Further improvements
In future I would add some features and changes like:
* CSS to provide better user experience
* For every repository add link to access it
* Aside from total count of stargazers I think of adding exact amount of stargazers for each repository
